# dYdX-v4-Report

This is the github repository for _dYdX v4: with Great Decentralization Comes Great Responsibility_, a report prepared by Xenophon Labs in anticipation of the launch of dYdX Chain. The `main.tex` file contains the report's skeleton, which imports text from the files in the `section` and `appendices` directories. The report's formatting was inspired by the `CSSullivanBusinessReport.cls` template, although this class has been modified significantly from its original [source](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/sullivan-business-report).
